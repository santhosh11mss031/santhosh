# Test Payment Gateway

The Test Gateway allows you to simulate an end to end transaction as if it were configured for a real payment gateway. This is for testing purposes only and should not be enabled on a production site. If you don’t have a payment gateway, you can operate the system in reservation mode only where no payment is required.

You can also operate many of our real payment gateways in sandbox or test mode.Test Payment Gateway
